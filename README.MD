#The Hi Roy! CLI

###Say hi to Roy through the command line

This is a work in progress, just started so once functionality is ready I'll work on turning it into an actual CLI.
Right now it's just a bash script you can execute to setup the API keys unless I've done some more work already. 
But at the time of writing this readme, that's all I expect to have done tonight.

* Download files into a directory of your choice

* Navigate your terminal to that directory

* Type ./hiroy.sh and follow instructions
